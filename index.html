                    <p>After earning a Marketing Degree from the College of Charleston I moved to London for a Sports Marketing
                        Internship with a local children's soccer coaching company - “We Make Footballers.” While at “We
                        Make Footballers”, I assisted with more than just marketing duties; being part of a small team I
                        took part in many facets of the business, including web and creative design. </p>

                    <p>After the struggle that accompanied dealing with and finding the right freelance developers, having to
                        do a little coding myself, and then seeing that the developer we used was working from Jamaica...
                        I realized there was a need for efficient, clean, and effective developers. Upon returning from my
                        Internship in London, I worked as a Mobile App Squad member for the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. I was
                        able to combine my love of sports with my interest in tech, but knew I needed to know more about
                        the tech side. Therefore, I enrolled into The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Charlotte.
